# Cellar Concierge - Sales Overview

## What is Cellar Concierge?

Cellar Concierge is a **premium digital wine cellar planning platform** that helps Berry Bros. & Rudd clients build and manage world-class wine collections. It combines the power of AI-driven recommendations with the personal touch of a dedicated Account Manager.

**Tagline**: *"Your personal wine curator, at your service"*

## The Problem We Solve

Building a fine wine collection is overwhelming. Clients face difficult decisions:

| Challenge | What Clients Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **What to buy** | "Which wines will appreciate? What should I drink now vs. cellar?" |
| **When to drink** | "Is this wine ready? How long should I hold it?" |
| **Budget allocation** | "How should I split my budget between investment and enjoyment?" |
| **Access** | "How do I get allocations of sought-after wines?" |
| **Trust** | "Is this wine properly stored? Is it authentic?" |

Traditional solutions don't scale:
- **Account Managers alone** can't provide 24/7 personalized guidance to every client
- **Self-service catalogs** lack personalization and feel transactional
- **Generic wine apps** don't understand fine wine investing or BBR's unique offerings

---

## The Solution

Cellar Concierge bridges this gap with a **three-pillar approach**:

### 1. Deep Personalization
A guided onboarding captures each client's unique profile:
- Investment vs. drinking priorities
- Budget and spending cadence
- Regional preferences and styles
- What they want to avoid
- Special occasions and goals

### 2. AI-Powered Recommendations
Intelligent suggestions based on:
- The client's profile and preferences
- Their existing cellar holdings
- Current BBR inventory and allocations
- Drinking windows and market conditions

### 3. Account Manager Curation
Human oversight ensures quality:
- AMs review and approve monthly plans
- Personal notes and exclusive offers
- Direct messaging for complex requests
- Facilitated resale when clients want to sell

## The Technology

Cellar Concierge is powered by **Ragu AI**, a sophisticated recommendation engine that:

- **Understands wine** - Trained on BBR's entire catalog, tasting notes, critic scores
- **Understands clients** - Learns from profile, behavior, and feedback
- **Understands context** - Considers portfolio gaps, drinking windows, market conditions
- **Speaks naturally** - Chat interface for intuitive interaction

The AI assists but never replaces the Account Manager relationship. Every recommendation can be reviewed, modified, and enhanced by a human expert.
